# Detect-Credit-Card-Fraud-with-Machine-Learning-in-R

In this project, I used R to implement a Collaborative-Filtering model and predicted the top 5 movies recommendations for the users.

Also, I designed an algorithm to build a similarity matrix to analyze the similarity shared between the movies and users.

Models used in this project: 
1. Gradient Boosting (GBM)
2. Artificial Neural Network
3. Decision Tree Model
4. Logistic Regression Model
